## Current Task

- ID: RAW-VISION-007
- Title: Add aggregate and per-camera raw vision views
- Phase: review
- Status: complete
- Size: medium
- Dependencies: RAW-VISION-001 implementation complete; live multi-camera input available for runtime confirmation.
- Exit Criteria:
  - `VisionPacketStore` retains latest detection state per camera instead of only the last received frame.
  - Viewer can switch between aggregate view and individual camera views.
  - Aggregate view renders combined balls, yellow robots, and blue robots from all known cameras.
  - Camera view renders the latest frame for the selected camera and exposes that camera's raw JSON.
  - Field canvas presentation follows `ssl-vision-client` direction with a source selector, boundary-aware field background, and zoom/pan controls.
  - Tests cover per-camera retention and aggregate snapshot behavior.
  - `dotnet test Tracker/Tracker.Tests/Tracker.Tests.csproj` passes.
  - `dotnet build Tracker/Tracker.Server/Tracker.Server.csproj` passes.
